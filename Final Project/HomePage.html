<!-- 
	One overall note: I would rename this file to "index.html", so that when someone goes to your 
	site, they just got o julieoue.github.io/FinalProject, instead of also having to type out the file name.

	Also, make sure your folder names have no spaces.  Web browsers don't always handle spaces well.

					not be more important than your page title (above), semantically.

		<div> tags do not take a body attribute.  You can delete that from the tag

<!-- This seems to be an extra <div> close tag.  Can be removed. -->

<!-- 
	Don't close your <body> tag before you are done putting stuff on your page.
	This </body> tag should go at the very botom.
