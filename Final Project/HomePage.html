<!-- 
	One overall note: I would rename this file to "index.html", so that when someone goes to your 
	site, they just got o julieoue.github.io/FinalProject, instead of also having to type out the file name.

	Also, make sure your folder names have no spaces.  Web browsers don't always handle spaces well.
